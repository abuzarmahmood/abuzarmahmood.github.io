## Current Research Spotlight

I'm currently investigating how feedback projections from the gustatory cortex influence taste processing in subcortical regions. This research challenges traditional views of sensory processing as a purely feedforward mechanism and suggests a more dynamic, recurrent network.

**Research Question:**  
How do cortical feedback projections modulate the temporal dynamics of taste processing in the amygdala and thalamus?
