## Development Tools

I've created several tools to streamline research workflows:

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/pr_blog_bot">PR Blog Bot</a>: A sophisticated bot for generating blog posts on pull requests, highlighting updates and new exciting features to our codebase. </li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/blech_github_bot">Blech GitHub Bot</a>: An automation tool that has streamlined our lab's GitHub workflow, saving approximately 5 hours per week in manual tasks.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/auto-commit">Auto Commit</a>: A tool for automatically generating informative git commit messages that has improved our team's version control practices.</li>
</ul>

## Data Analysis & Visualization

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/video_movement_frequency">Video Movement Frequency</a>: A specialized tool for analyzing movement frequency in videos, crucial for behavioral neuroscience research and monitoring vital signs under anesthesia.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/freq_monitor_streamlit">Freq Monitor Streamlit</a>: An interactive frequency monitoring dashboard built with Streamlit, making complex data accessible to non-technical team members.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/pytau">PyTau</a>: A Python library for changepoint calculations that has simplified a common analysis task in our research.</li>
</ul>

## Educational & AI Projects

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/teachables">Teachables</a>: A platform for disseminating educational content that has been used in two graduate-level neuroscience courses.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/neuRecommend">NeuRecommend</a>: A classifier for automated/ semi-automated neural data extraction.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/KatzGPT">KatzGPT</a>: A specialized GPT-based chatbot for answering questions about taste neuroscience.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/ocr_database">OCR Database</a>: A database system for optical character recognition that has digitized over 1,000 pages of historical research notes.</li>
</ul>

## Collaborate With Me

I'm always looking for collaboration opportunities and feedback on my projects. If you're interested in working together or have questions about any of these tools, please [contact me](/contact/). I'm particularly interested in partnerships that bridge neuroscience research with cutting-edge technology.
