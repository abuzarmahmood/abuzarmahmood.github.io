## Research Projects

### Neuroscience Research

#### Coupled Dynamics in Taste Processing (2023)

Investigated the coordination of taste-evoked activity between the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and gustatory cortex (GC), demonstrating that these regions act as a coupled network during taste processing. This research revealed that sudden transitions in neural activity occur near-simultaneously in both regions, suggesting collective processing in a distributed neural network. The work provides novel insights into real-time communication between brain regions during sensory processing.

**Key Findings:**
- BLA and GC response magnitudes covary across trials
- Epoch-specific changes in phase coherence between regions
- Near-simultaneous transitions despite trial-to-trial variability
- Evidence for recurrent attractor network dynamics

**Publication:** [Journal of Neuroscience, 2023](https://www.jneurosci.org/content/43/3/386)

#### Illness Modulation of Taste Responses (2022)

Examined how illness states alter gustatory cortical responses in rats, revealing that LiCl-induced sickness reduces taste response magnitudes and discriminability while enhancing palatability-related coding. This research demonstrates how internal states profoundly impact sensory processing and consumption decisions.

**Key Findings:**
- Illness alters 7-12 Hz LFP power in gustatory cortex
- Reduced taste discriminability during illness
- Enhanced palatability coding reflecting "good-bad" simplification
- Direct link between neural changes and consumption behavior

**Publication:** [PLOS Biology, 2022](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3001537)

#### Dynamic Neural Function (2021)

Contributed to a comprehensive review challenging the notion of fixed neural function, arguing that neural populations serve different functions across time scales. This work emphasizes the importance of temporal and network context in understanding neural computation.

**Key Insights:**
- Neural responses are dynamic across multiple time scales
- Function of neuron groups changes from moment to moment
- Importance of temporal context in neural function attribution
- Network state determines functional role of neural populations

**Publication:** [Current Opinion in Physiology, 2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8967145/)

### Cardiovascular & Pharmacology Research

#### AT2 Receptor Agonist in Obesity (2021)

Investigated the effects of novel AT2R agonist NP-6A4 on cardiac function in obese rats, demonstrating suppression of inflammatory cytokine networks and attenuation of cardiac damage. This research revealed a unique anti-inflammatory mechanism that could protect heart tissue from obesity-induced damage.

**Key Findings:**
- NP-6A4 attenuated cardiac dysfunction and fibrosis
- Suppressed 19 inflammatory cytokines including those involved in cytokine storms
- Activated novel anti-inflammatory network of 21 proteins
- Protective effects independent of blood pressure modulation

**Publication:** [Frontiers in Pharmacology, 2021](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2021.693167)

#### Cardiovascular Cell Stress Response (2015)

Compared effects of various cardiovascular drugs on nutrient-stressed cells, identifying unique protective mechanisms of AT2R agonist NP-6A4. This work revealed the AT2R-MCL-1 axis as a critical pathway for cardiovascular cell survival under stress conditions.

**Key Findings:**
- NP-6A4 increased cell viability through AT2R activation
- Enhanced MCL-1 expression critical for cell survival
- Distinct cellular response signatures for different drug classes
- Novel mechanism for cardiovascular protection under nutrient stress

**Publication:** [PLOS ONE, 2015](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0144824)

#### Rapamycin Effects in Diabetes (2017)

Examined differential regulation of cardiac function and intracardiac cytokines by rapamycin in healthy versus diabetic rats, revealing fundamental differences in immune response that affect treatment outcomes.

**Key Findings:**
- Differential cytokine modulation in healthy vs. diabetic hearts
- Rapamycin improved some cardiac parameters but reversed others in diabetic rats
- Suppression of intracardiac immune defense in diabetic models
- Importance of disease state in determining drug efficacy

**Publication:** [Oxidative Medicine and Cellular Longevity, 2017](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/omcl/2017/5724046/)
