# Innovations at the Intersection of Neuroscience and Technology

Welcome to my projects portfolio. Here you'll discover how I'm leveraging technology to advance neuroscience research and solve complex problems.

## Featured Projects

### [AutoSlide](https://github.com/pulakatlab/auto_slide)

A semi-supervised machine vision pipeline for calculating interstitial fibrosis from histological samples. This project has revolutionized our lab's analysis workflow, reducing processing time by 80% while maintaining high accuracy.

### [BlechRNN](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/blechRNN)

An innovative recurrent neural network implementation for analyzing temporal patterns in neural data. This tool has enabled new insights into taste processing dynamics.

## Development Tools

I've created several tools to streamline research workflows:

- [PR Blog Bot](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/pr_blog_bot): A sophisticated bot for generating blog posts on pull requests, highlighting updates and new exciting features to our codebase.
- [Blech GitHub Bot](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/blech_github_bot): An automation tool that has streamlined our lab's GitHub workflow, saving approximately 5 hours per week in manual tasks.
- [Auto Commit](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/auto-commit): A tool for automatically generating informative git commit messages that has improved our team's version control practices.

## Data Analysis & Visualization

- [Video Movement Frequency](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/video_movement_frequency): A specialized tool for analyzing movement frequency in videos, crucial for behavioral neuroscience research and monitoring vital signs under anesthesia.
- [Freq Monitor Streamlit](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/freq_monitor_streamlit): An interactive frequency monitoring dashboard built with Streamlit, making complex data accessible to non-technical team members.
- [PyTau](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/pytau): A Python library for changepoint calculations that has simplified a common analysis task in our research.

## Educational & AI Projects

- [Teachables](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/teachables): A platform for disseminating educational content that has been used in two graduate-level neuroscience courses.
- [NeuRecommend](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/neuRecommend): A classifier for automated/ semi-automated neural data extraction.
- [KatzGPT](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/KatzGPT): A specialized GPT-based chatbot for answering questions about taste neuroscience.
- [OCR Database](https://github.com/abuzarmahmood/ocr_database): A database system for optical character recognition that has digitized over 1,000 pages of historical research notes.

## Collaborate With Me

I'm always looking for collaboration opportunities and feedback on my projects. If you're interested in working together or have questions about any of these tools, please [contact me](/contact/). I'm particularly interested in partnerships that bridge neuroscience research with cutting-edge technology.
