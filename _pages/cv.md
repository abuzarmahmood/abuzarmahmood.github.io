Research experience
======
* <b>Postdoctoral Researcher</b>, Brandeis University, MA	<span style="float:right;">Starting April 2023</span>
  * <u>Project</u>: Dynamics of information flow during the evoked taste response
  * <u>Research Summary</u> : My doctoral research showed that cortical and amygdalar activity is coordinated for taste processing, however, the dynamics of directionality of this influence are not known. Furthermore, cortex receives simultaneous input from both amygdalar and thalamic pathways, however neither the dynamics of thalamo-cortical interaction, nor the interplay between limbic and thalamic input on cortex have not been investigated. This project proposes to investigate the dynamics of influence of the limbic and thalamic pathways on activity in the gustatory cortex and investigate the role of feedback projections from the gustatory cortex to the basolateral amygdala and gustatory thalamus. 
* <b>Ph.D. Researcher</b>, Brandeis University, MA	<span style="float:right;">2017 â€“ Feb 2023</span>
  * <u>Thesis Advisor:</u> Donald B. Katz
  * <u>Thesis Title:</u> Multi-region Coordination for Taste Processing in the Rodent Brain
  * <u>Research Summary</u> : Multiple recurrently-connected brain regions are involved in taste processing, however, the real-time interactions between brain regions for taste processing has not been investigated. This project investigated the dynamics of coordination between the basolateral amygdala and the gustatory cortex and tested whether the regions phenomenologically behave as an attractor network.  
* <b>Data Science Intern</b>, TrackstarHQ, NY	<span style="float:right;">2022</span>
  * <u>Research Summary</u> : Developed computational models to detect outliers and changepoints in online timeseries data, and contributed to creating and managing infrastructure for performing online inference.
* <b>Undergraduate Researcher</b>, University of Missouri, MO	<span style="float:right;">2013-2017</span>
  * <u>Research Advisor:</u>  Lakshmi Pulakat
  * <u>Research Summary</u> : Projects involving : 1) investigation of a novel pharmaceutical drug for treatment of cardiovascular disease and diabetes, 2) pre-clinical testing of a novel fluidics device for delivering drugs and genetic material
